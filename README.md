# Online Bookstore Webpage

This is a simple webpage for an online bookstore, built using HTML and CSS. The webpage consists of a landing page that showcases some featured books, a search form to find books by title or author, and a page with the details of a selected book. The webpage is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices.

The main HTML file of the webpage is index.html, which includes the structure of the landing page and links to the other pages. The CSS styles are defined in the style.css file, which contains the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual elements of the webpage. The images of the featured books are stored in the img folder, and the icons used in the webpage are provided by Font Awesome.

The webpage was created as a personal project to practice HTML and CSS skills and to showcase a simple yet functional design for an online bookstore. Feel free to use and modify the code for your own projects, or to suggest improvements and feedback. Happy reading!
